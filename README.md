Hello. This is my weather tracker. You are able to select one of the pre-destined cities in the bottom left corner. You can also search up specific cities via the textarea in the top left corner. The top right will present the current weather and the bottom right row will present the next 5 days weather. All weather presentation areas will have icons indicating the weather type at the time and date of prediction and the top right also includes the UV number to better prepare the user to potentially need sunblock.
